# Google Earth Overlay Server (GEOS)

## Notice

> FORKED by [DingJunyao][ding_gh] from [upstream repo][upstream]

[Upstream][upstream] has been archived discarding [my bug fix][my_bug_fix],
so I'll continue maintaining it (Currently it just for adding my bug fix in it).

I am not so good in this field,
and I use it just for displaying and recording track into videos in Google Earth
with customize map overlays,
so fork, push and open pull requests if you find bugs or want to add new features.

Due to Python package name, the name will be modified soon.
